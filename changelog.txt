Changelog for SEOLite
=====================
The dates in this changelog use international date format: YYYY-MM-DD (ISO8601)

1.3.5 - 2012-02-23
------------------
* Increased the size of the "default_keywords" and "default_description" fields to 1024 in the database

1.3.4 - 2011-12-19
------------------
* Added support for config override of publish tab title (e.g. $config['seo_lite_tab_title'] = 'SEO';)

1.3.3 - 2011-10-14
------------------
* Fixed bug where {canonical_url} would be blank on standard channel entries

1.3.2 - 2011-09-27
------------------
* Changed constructor name

1.3.1 - 2011-09-02
------------------
* Fix for canonical URLs on pages / structure pages


1.3 - 2011-08-30
------------------
* Added support for category_url_title for fetching titles/descriptions of categories (for use as seo metadata)
* Added support for using seo_lite as a tag pair (if done the template won't be used, good for overriding etc.)
* Fixed minor bug in backend where the instructions would not hide after clicking view/hide

1.2.5 - 2011-03-18
------------------
* French language file added
* Renamed language key "welcome" to "seo_lite_welcome" as this sometimes confliced with other modules who used the same language key

1.2.4 - 2011-02-23
------------------

This update includes database changes and requires that you visit the module in the backend (EE will then automatically run the update script).)

* htmlspecialchars() all metadata before output (there were problems with the use of quotes etc. in default description)
* Increased size of the default keywords / descripton to 1024 chars
* Changed coltype of default_title_postfix to VARCHAR(60) instead of CHAR(60) (char would strip trailing space, thus the need for &nbsp; .. that's no longer needed)


1.2.3 - 2011-02-21
------------------

* Added support for {canonical_url} for use in the SEOLite template like this:	<link rel=“canonical” href='{canonical_url}' />
* Added 'ignore_last_segments' parameter which tells SEO Lite to ignore the X last url segments (ie. 2 would be logical for URL: entries/some_entry_here/sort/asc)
* Improved support for pages - the "Pages URI" will now override "URL Title"
* Minor change in how the "title_postfix" parameter works - the default postfix (specified in admin) will now always be added after this
